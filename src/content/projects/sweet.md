**Sweet** is a **S**oftware **E**ngineering **E**xercise for **T**yping. In other words, it's a touch typing exercise command line interface specifically designed for programmers.

# Motivation

For a while I found it difficult to type characters that are often found in code, including brackets, parentheses, and special characters. I needed to improve my typing speed to make my development experience less painful.

I used to use typing web applications including [SpeedTyper.dev](https://www.speedtyper.dev/) and [SpeedCoder](https://www.speedcoder.net/). However, I wanted to create a solution that didn't require opening a web page.

Additionally, I hadn't used the Go language before, so I figured this was a fun opportunity to try it out!

# Goals

This software is successful if the following are done:

- My typing speed increases and I become more comfortable typing code
- I can practice writing code faster than opening a web browser to type code
