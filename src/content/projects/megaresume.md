MegaResume is a resume building application which simplifies the creation of single-page resumes. By selecting specific tags, users can filter their experience and accomplishments based on a job description.

This application is designed for people that have a wide breadth of experience, but find job applications that do not require all of their skills as values

# Motivation

Previously to solve this problem, I created a master resume document which contained all of my experience. When I would create a resume for a specific job, my process would look like this:

- Create a copy of the master document into a new file and open it.
- Find the experience that was irrelevant to the job description.
- Delete the irrelevant job experience.
- Format the document to ensure it remained at one page.

This was a very time-consuming process which took the wind out of my sails when searching for work. However, MegaResume has made this process much easier to do!

# Goals

This application is the most useful if the following happens:

- My time to apply for jobs is reduced
- The friction to apply for a job is reduced
- I can increase the number of job application in a shorter period of time
- I get more responses from my resume
- My resumes that are generated are readable by application tracking software
- I can use this device on mobile devices
