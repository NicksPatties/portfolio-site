TimeClock is an Android application that helps users quickly record and analyze how they spend their time. This is my first foray into Android application development.

# Motivation

I was not sure how much time I was spending working on code each day. I've used a couple time management techniques, but I wanted to know whether they were actually working. Since I have my cell phone with me most of the time, then an application that I use on my phone would be the most useful tool.

# Goals

To make this useful for me, I want it to do these things:

- Easily start and stop recording events
- Display the recordings in useful ways
