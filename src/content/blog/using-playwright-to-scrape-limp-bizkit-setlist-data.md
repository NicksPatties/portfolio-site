Limp Bizkit has invited fans on stage in the past to perform with them. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that sounds fucking cool. Fans have rapped, played guitar, and even formed entire bands.

What is the likelihood that Limp Bizkit will invite us on stage to play a song? Which songs should we play that will give us the greatest chance of being picked? These are questions that can be answered when we have access to data.

Fortunately, there's a resource that is a kind of wikipedia for live music called Setlist.fm. This will have the data we need to figure this out. Plus, due to Limp Bizkit's popularity, performances can be corroborated with video evidence from YouTube, Instagram, or other platforms.

To obtain this data automatically, we can use playwright to automatically browse and select those elements. We'll then save the output to a file, and then use some command line applications to organize and understand the data.

# The data source

This is the [Limp Bizkit page](https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/limp-bizkit-33d69c2d.html) that we will take our data from.

To access this data, we use playwright to connect to our page.

# Obtaining data

If you just want to see the repository where the scraper code is contained, you can [view it here](https://github.com/NicksPatties/lb-scraper). I'll share a quick rundown of my process below.

If you're familiar with Playwright, you may have used it in end-to-end tests. Your project may have had some sort of configuration file, defining which browsers to use, or what commands to run to start the test. This is not necessary for us.

## Initializing the browser

Instead, we can obtain the variables to automate a webpage with the following statements.

```ts
import { chromium } from "playwright";

// ...
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();
const page = await context.newPage();
```

This code starts a new instance of Chromium browser, then opens a new browser context (think a user profile in a web browser), and then a new page. We'll be interacting with pages and browser contexts the most during this exercise. Now, which page will we open?

## Iterating through pages

It may make sense to take the link from above and plug it into the `page.goto` function, which will navigate the page to the provided URL.

```ts
await page.goto("https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/limp-bizkit-33d69c2d.html");
```

However, there's a simpler option. If you're looking at the Limp Bizkit setlist page linked above, try clicking on the next page links underneath the sets, and look at the URL. Notice the query parameter called `page` in the URL.

Instead of having playwright click the next page link, we can pass the URL with the query parameter directly into the `page.goto` function! This simplifies our code a little bit, only requiring us to loop through a range of page indices. It's a nice affordance. I'm interested in the data, not verifying that certain links work, like in an e2e test.

So the `goto` function becomes this instead:

```ts
await page.goto(
  `https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/limp-bizkit-33d69c2d.html?page=${currPage}`,
);
```

Well then how do we know what page we're currently on, and what are our bounds? I sloppily assigned some values for those starting and ending boundaries with the expectation that they would not change very often. Also, I'll only need to perform this scraping once since the analysis would only be relevant up until the point my friend and I decide what songs to play.

In short, we'll start with `1`, and then go up to `105`, which is the number of total pages of Limp Bizkit set lists at the time of writing.

## Obtaining data from a set list

Now that we know how to go from page to page, we can navigate to an individual set list, and start grabbing the data we need. To do this, we'll use locators to navigate to a set list page, and then to the individual songs and their details.

On the page of set lists, the following will get you the list of links to individual set lists. In other words, the songs played at a specific concert.

```ts
const setLinks = await page.locator("a.summary.url").all();
```

<details class="info">
<summary>Why use <code>"a.summary.url"</code> as your locator?</summary>

[Playwright's Locators documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) offers some best practices on the types of locators to use. Note that CSS locators, like the one above, should be used as a last resort. It's possible the DOM can change, and the locator will find an incorrect node, if at all.

But again, I'm not verifying a page functions correctly, but I need the data from within the page. Changes in the DOM may be an issue if this script is called on a regular basis. However, I intend to only run this a few times. CSS selectors are good enough for my needs.

To find the best selector, I recommend inspecting the page in a browser. Try experimenting with some selectors in the console by calling `document.querySelectorAll('.your.selector')`. Did you get all the elements you wanted to find? If so, then great! The selector will work perfectly as the input of the `locator` function.

It's possible to [generate tests with Playwright to simplify finding the right locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen#introduction), but the code generator prefers more accurate selectors that may be overkill for your application. That's why I found the correct selectors manually.

</details>

I wanted to open a new page for each URL in this list, just in case I don't accidentally lose any progress if I navigate to another location from the same page. (I'm not sure if creating separate windows matters. Perhaps I can simplify my code by just clicking a link with `setLink.click()`.)

```ts
for (const setLink of setLinks) {
  const setLinkUrl: string | null = await setLink.getAttribute("href");

  if (!setLinkUrl) {
    continue;
  }

  // open a new page, since I don't want to lose my progress
  const setLinkPage = await context.newPage();

  // the href has a relative path, so we remove the `../` from it
  await setLinkPage.goto(`https://www.setlist.fm/${setLinkUrl.slice(3)}`);

  //...
}
```

The `setLinkPage` has the list of songs we want to copy. We'll use another locator to find the individual songs that we'd like to record. If you're looking at an individual set list page, notice there could be different _types_ of songs, performed songs and tape recordings. The distinction is made clear in the HTML and CSS selectors.

```html
<!-- ... -->
<ol class="songsList">
  <li class="setlistParts tape"><!-- Sweet Home Alabama--></li>
  <li class="setlistParts song"><!-- Break Stuff--></li>
  <!-- ... -->
</ol>
<!-- ... -->
```

Therefore, our locators to find the songs that Limp Bizkit performed at a given concert looks like this:

```ts
const songData = await setLinkPage.locator(".setlistParts.song").all();
```

We now have all the songs for all the concerts Limp Bizkit has performed to work with. But what data specifically do we care about?

## Grabbing the right data

It's safe to say that the more data that is obtained, the easier it is to see patterns within that data. The fewer data you have, the harder it is to work with.

Since my friend and I are trying to figure out which songs we should learn to give ourselves the greatest chances of being invited on stage to perform, at the very least, we need to know:

- The name of the song
- The notes regarding the song performed
- The date when the song was performed

With this information, we should be able to have a distinct list of performed songs and their corresponding notes, right? Not quite! There are some considerations to account for which will influence what data should be grabbed.

### Encores?

It's possible a song is played more than once, and it's also possible that one performance may not feature a guest, while another does. To distinguish between two performances of the same song, we can add another field to our data:

- The order in which the song is played

This order variable can also answer this question: When does Limp Bizkit like to invite a fan on stage to perform? This can influence our strategy of when we should show our interest in performing on stage.

### Multiple performances during one day

Although highly unlikely, I wanted to make sure that my data would not get messed up if Limp Bizkit performed in multiple shows during a single day. To do so, I also added this data to the collection.

- The name of the show performed

This also helps ensure individual performances are unique enough that they are not accidentally double counted or filtered out.

# Handling the data

At this point, we can now run our script and save the file for further review. The script creates a `tsv` file containing all the songs performed by Limp Bizkit at each of their concerts, along with notes about special cases, like fan performances.

Let's assume our data is called `data.tsv`.

We can use some built-in command line applications to sanitize our data, and filter it out into different categories as needed.

## `sort`

First, we'll remove any duplicate rows from the data with the `sort` command. Duplicates may appear if the script was run more than once on the same set list pages.

```sh
sort -u data.tsv >> data-uniq.tsv
```

- `-u` means only unique lines in the file will be shown

## `wc`

How many times in total did Limp Bizkit play a song? We can find this out by using the `wc` command.

```sh
‚ùØ wc -l data.tsv
   9909 data.tsv
```

- `-l` means return the number of lines in the given files.

If each line is a song that Limp Bizkit performed, then the total count is an impressive **9909** songs performed to a live audience.

`wc` can also be used to verify if our previous `sort` command filtered out any data or not.

```sh
‚ùØ wc -l data.tsv data-uniq.tsv
   9909 data.tsv
   9909 data-uniq.tsv
  19818 total
```

In this case, `sort` didn't filter anything out, so our data looks OK to use.

## `cut`

`cut` can be used to obtain data from a specific column. By default, `cut` can process `tsv` files without any additional parameters.

How many concerts did Limp Bizkit play in their lifetime? We can find out using a combination of the above commands!

```sh
‚ùØ cut --fields=4 data.tsv | sort -u | wc -l
635
```

- `--fields=4` tells `cut` to only get the 4th column from this dataset. This argument can accept single columns, multiple columns (`--fields=1,3`), or a range of columns (`--fields=1-3`).

Notice that we're piping the output from each command and using it as the input of the next. First, we grab the concert name column from the `data.tsv` file. Then, we filter out repeated lines with `sort -u`. Finally, we count with lines of output with `wc -l`, which gives us our final answer of **635**.

## `grep`

This command may be the most familiar to command line enthusiasts. `grep` is used to find instances of a search query within a file. How many times did Limp Bizkit perform with fans on stage? We can find out by using `grep` like so.

```sh
‚ùØ grep --extended-regexp "(fan|audience|guest)" data.tsv | wc -l
119
```

<details class="warning">
<summary>How accurate is this filtering?</summary>

Pretty accurate, but there are some edge cases. Consider these two entries.

| Order | Song      | Info                                              |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 9     | Pollution | (With a fan)                                      |
| 9     | Dad Vibes | (With 2 fans on stage only taking selfies/videos) |

The first entry has the info "With a fan." This could mean "with a fan on stage dancing", or "with a fan performing alongside the band." The level of the fan's involvement is not clear, so in those cases, I like to find some evidence of what the fan did, typically via videos on social media.

The second entry is more clear; they were not performing alongside the band, and were only present on stage. This is enough to reveal a downfall of my filtering technique, however. I may have entries that I don't care about.

</details>

This is enough information to start estimating the likelihood we can perform with Limp Bizkit live. If we divide the number of songs fans performed with the number of songs they played in total, we get this:

**119** songs performed with fans / **9909** total songs performed = **0.012** = **1.2%**

This is a little bit discouraging. Note that this does not even filter out the fan performances with specifically fan performances with instruments.

```sh
‚ùØ grep --extended-regexp "(fan|audience|guest)" data.tsv | grep --extended-regex "(guitar|bass|band|instrument)" | wc -l
15
```

**15** songs performed with fans on instruments / **9909** total songs performed = **0.0015** = **0.15%**

Even without careful calculations, the numbers are staggeringly low. Assuming that everything goes according to plan, a less than one percent chance of success is enough to not even try.

But as people who know me may understand, I'm not so easily deterred.

# Looking at the data another way

The analysis from above does not provide the entire picture. There are some other questions I would like to ask. For instance, has Limp Bizkit been performing with fans more often in recent years? Are there specific songs that are more likely to be selected? Are there techniques we can use to increase the likelihood of us getting selected to perform?

Limp Bizkit is open to fans performing on stage. Perhaps the low numbers don't represent their willingness or opportunity to let fans on, but **the drive of the fans to perform themselves.**

In my Limp Bizkit scraper repository, I added a spreadsheet document where I've been doing some analysis. I'll share a couple of the things I did within the sheet.

## Finding video evidence

As I was working with the data, I was searching for video evidence of guests performing with Limp Bizkit to double-check some of the filtered results from above. As such, I added a "Video URL" column.

Finding the data was simple with what I already had. Videos usually have the name of the song performed, the date, and the name of the concert in their titles. These videos I found included some fun information about these interactions, including these fun tidbits:

- [Fred had a clone of himself perform with him one time in Vegas!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClShNpgcZHo)
- During a 2023 performance in Germany, Fred was under the weather, but some legendary fans stepped up to keep the show going! ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDcL2-uSum4), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYZ59wiywWc), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEls8a8SaNY))
- Some fans in Argentina got on stage and almost messed up Fred's entrance. Diplomatically, he shares ["I like those guys, but they were very boring."](https://youtu.be/R4fK7RB9N4M?si=qhNM6o_simKlyue0&t=2230)

Most importantly, these videos verify whether a fan performance actually takes place, which can impact what songs my friend and I should prioritize learning. If fans have a tendency to only get up on stage and dance to a given song, that decreases the likelihood Limp Bizkit will allow having fans play that song.

## Having a choice in song?

Speaking of the band letting fans play songs, I discovered through those videos that fans were sometimes given a choice of song to play. If fans were lucky enough to be invited on stage, one of three things happen:

- Limp Bizkit assigns a song for them to play (["You have to be able to play Hot Dog."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjmDHsCTGnA))
- The fan chooses what song they want to play, and the band accepts their choice. (["What's he going to play?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2IflT9nLY))
- The fan chooses what song they want to play, **but the band refuses their choice.** (["What do you want? ... No 'Break Stuff' tonight."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9VbPNrVy8g))

Fortunately, the numbers show that a majority of the time fans are let on stage, they have the choice of what song to play. Of the 16 times fans were invited to play instruments on stage with the band, fans got to choose which song to play 12 times. In short, **75% of the time fans were invited on stage, they had a choice of song.**

## Signs

If you previewed the videos linked above, you may have noticed that some fans that were invited on stage _had signs_.

- A little fan [had a sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTonxS_H-NM) asking if he could "Break Stuff" with Fred.
- A fan [held a sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzyVT-nyVcc) and grabbed Fred's attention in Germany.

My findings revealed that if we had signs, and all other factors went in our favor, we would have a 100% chance of being invited up. More clearly, **having a sign always increases our chances of being picked to play**. Such an advantage cannot be overlooked, so creating signs showing that we want to play is essential.

## Order and timing

Since we grabbed the order that each song was played, we can estimate when we should make our way to the front of the stage, or at the very least, how much time we have to position ourselves in the most advantageous way.

After counting the total songs in each concert for each song that was performed with fans on instruments, I had the data at my disposal to calculate at what portion of the concert the song took place. Calculating the _timing ratio_ of each song played leads to this graph.

[line graph of the moment when songs with fans on instruments were played in each concert]()

On average, fans with instruments performed **about halfway through the concert**. Given that the average number of songs played in 2024 is 12, **we'll need to start positioning ourselves in the crowd by the time 5 songs have played**. This should give us plenty of time to make our way to the front.

# Conclusion

Although this data was extremely discouraging at first, it was very useful for finding additional information about the times fans _did_ perform with the band. Manipulating and adding more information has given my friend and me some strategies we wouldn't have found otherwise. To maximize those changes to play with Limp Bizkit during their show, my friend and I will do the following:

- Prepare multiple songs to play, in case our first choice is not available
- Create an eye-catching sign, sharing our intent to play with the band
- Get to the front of the crowd with our signs ready by the time the concert is half-way done

This begs the question, **which songs should we pick to perform?** We'll refer to this chart below for the answer.

[pie chart of times fans performed with Limp Bizkit on stage with instruments]()
The majority of times that the stars align for these lucky fans, they'll play either **My Way** or **Hot Dog**. These are our second and third choice of song. So then what's our first choice?

**9 Teen 90 Nine**, specifically to chug on this riff here.

## Future improvements?

Although Playwright, command line tools, and spreadsheets have gotten me this far, there are some things I would like to consider if I were to make this again.

### Improving scraping speed

Running Playwright takes time. When running in headless mode, an entire browser runs in the background, rendering the output of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which takes a couple seconds.

Now, consider this command, which obtains a specific set list and searches for the same song items as the locator in my Playwright script.

```sh
curl https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/limp-bizkit/2024/megaland-landgraaf-netherlands-3babf870.html | grep --after-context=3 "setlistParts song"
```

We can find the same data required for our analysis in **a fraction of the time**. This is possible since the data we're looking for is included in the HTML document from setlist.fm; there's no need to wait for JavaScript to request and load data separate from the document!

If we can take advantage of this, then we can finish scraping data much faster than with Playwright! This could make repeat runs more efficient. The only thing that's missing is a DOM parser to simplify development.

### Replace spreadsheets with a database

I'll admit, adding the data to a spreadsheet seemed like the easiest solution. However, many of the things I was trying to do in the spreadsheet can be accomplished with a database with a robust querying language. Using a spreadsheet was straightforward since I had more control to quickly add, remove, and organize data via columns.

However, using an actual database will be easier to perform certain tasks, like verifying that entries are unique, or fetching data that meets certain conditions. Additionally, I wouldn't need to rely on command line tools to filter and sort data.

For data visualization, instead of using a spreadsheet with extremely clunky cart generation, a data visualization library like D3 can be used to create interactive graphs and charts instead.

This has been a fun project, and I hope you enjoyed reading. I'm off to write more code and practice some more riffs. Stay tuned for more updates! I'll also let you all know if my strategy is successful. ;)
