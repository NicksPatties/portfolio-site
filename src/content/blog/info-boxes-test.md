Here are some boxes that I think would be useful for my site.

<div class="info">

Pro-tip!

You can make these boxes with text look pretty good by just using the page, but perhaps I want to just do something simpler?

</div>

I've been busy making these boxes look real good, but are they good enough?

<div class="warning">

This right here is a warning. You should be careful when dealing with this stuff.

**Does this work**

</div>

<div class="danger">

Look out! There's a problem here!

</div>

This concludes the test. Thanks for reading!
