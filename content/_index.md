Hi! This is a new site built with Hugo. Pretty cool, huh?

Anyways, my name's Nick. I like to write code that does useful stuff for people. I'm driven by my desire to simplify complex problems and enabling people to grow!

This website it built with Hugo. I'm still figuring it out, but soon, this site will look nice and pretty. I'm sure of it!

This is the part where I talk about myself a little bit and get a feel for what's happening, but I'm not sure what I'm going to say here, haha.

Perhaps I can put some testimonials in here to talk about my abilities
