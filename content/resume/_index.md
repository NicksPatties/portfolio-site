# Sweet
## Software Engineer 2023-05 2023-06
* Designed, built, and released Sweet, a command line touch typing game for software engineers using Go. Since using it, my coding speed has improved by 10 words per minute!
* Created MVPs of the application with JavaScript, Python, and Go to compare and contrast performance and developer experience.
* Wrote unit tests to verify the functionality of key features of the application, including file reading, user input, and calculating results.
* Sweet has a start up time that is at least 100 times faster than popular web based touch-typing games. (monkeytype.com: 2.0s, speedtyper.net: 1.7s, Sweet: 17ms)
* Released the application on GitHub and pkg.go.dev site within a month of learning how to use Go.

# MegaResume
## Software Engineer 2022-09 2023-01
* Created a resume building web application using SvelteKit, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS called MegaResume, which was used to build over 70 resumes.
* Built a tag system with TypeScript to select which skills to show in a resume based on a job's requirements. Making a resume in this way is about 10 times faster than editing a document by hand in a word processor.
* MegaResume automatically saves the user's progress within the browser's local storage. Users can immediately continue editing from where they left off.
* Wrote a preview component using Svelte stores, HTML, and CSS. Users can save their resume as a PDF document, which appears exactly as displayed in the preview.
* Used CSS media queries to build a mobile interface that is usable on Android and iOS mobile devices.
* Wrote unit tests with Vitest and end to end tests with Playwright to verify the correctness of critical features and bug fixes.
* Used GitHub actions to build a CI/CD pipeline, automatically running tests for each pull request, and deploying changes to production when changes are merged.

# TimeClock
## Android Engineer 2021-09 2022-09
* Created Android application called TimeClock using Kotlin and Material UI, which records activities and shows how time is spent. To date, it has recorded 360 hours of my tasks, leading to increased concentration.
* Used Kotlin to add a Pomodoro timer functionality to TimeClock thanks to user feedback. Users improved their focus on their tasks using this feature.
* Used GitHub Projects and Issues to create user stories and plan sprints. Prioritized MVP issues to release TimeClock as soon as possible.
* Created test plans for the user stories to verify their completeness. Used JUnit and Kotlin to write unit tests and integration tests, maintaining app functionality when user stories were completed.
* Created flow to allow customers to submit feedback through GitHub. Created feature request and bug report templates to speed up identification and triaging of tasks. 
* Used GitHub Actions to automate building and testing TimeClock during pull requests. Increased speed in which changes were submitted and verified.
* Released the TimeClock application to both Google Play and F-Droid marketplaces, and used Fastlane to quickly deploy updates to both marketplaces.


# Climb Tournament Systems
## Android Engineer 2021-04 2021-08
* Created an interactive bracket view for a mobile tournament management app. Quickly accustomed myself to the code to add significant features.
* The bracket view can search a competitor to highlight their progress in the tournament, and matches can be tapped to easily update its details and assign winners

# The Walt Disney Company
## Software Engineer 2020-02 2021-02
* Replaced deprecated UI components for Disney's OneID user management software with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. Incremental updates allowed ESPN, National Geographic, and more to gain security and UI benefits without interrupting service for millions of users.
* Created a bridge between web apps and native mobile Android apps with JavaScript and Kotlin. The user login and management experience remained consistent on web and mobile apps with this change.
* Used JavaScript and CSS to include features for business partners, including themable components, and user flow opt-in controls. These kept other teams from building their own tools, saving The Walt Disney Company hundreds of man-hours of development time.
* Participated in bi-weekly sprint planning meetings, and daily SCRUM meetings to manage task completion. Logged task progress and user stories using Jira.
* Participated in on-call cycle, monitoring software health using New Relic Metrics. Wrote SQL queries to monitor effectiveness of newly released features.

# Amazon Fulfillment Technologies, Amazon.com Inc.
## Web Development Engineer 2016-06 2019-08
* Co-authored a client-sided task orchestration framework in JavaScript and Ruby. This software powered workflows within fulfillment centers around the world, improving the performance and safety of hundreds of fulfillment associates.
* Used React, HTML, and SCSS to build over 50 responsive, animating components. These components rendered smoothly on all screen sizes and old hardware, saving millions of dollars on replacing technology.
* Integrated React web app with Java microservices to create a simplified associate login process. By scanning a badge instead of typing credentials, associates could log in and start their workday in 1/10th of the time.
* Promptly addressed customer feedback of components to improve their experience, including word-based truncation, progress bar completion rate, manager-to-associate messaging, and content-aware notifications.
* Documented a process to test changes to front end software directly on fulfillment hand scanners. Bugs that were not identifiable in device emulators were caught and removed before changes went live.
* Removed cross site request forgery (XSRF) threats in HTML forms within fulfillment tools. Created a JavaScript bookmarklet to find vulnerable forms, fixing XSRF vulnerabilities in a quarter of the time.
* Replaced end-of-life, custom JavaScript build software with NPM and Webpack. Affected software packages now used standard front end tools, and saw build times for JS packages reduced by half.
* Collaborated with UX Designers to document human centered UI best practices. Created a CSS package to bring those best practices to HTML elements, regardless of technology stack.
* Led a technical book club, where I presented interesting tech topics and discussed with coworkers how they could be applied to their day-to-day activities.
* Monitored and managed CI/CD pipelines. Presented code changes to teammates in staging environments, and promoted code changes to production when they were ready to ship.
* Participated in weekly sprint planning meetings, defining and estimating tasks, and presenting project updates. Participated and led daily SCRUM meetings.
